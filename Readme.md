# Grandpy Bot

Welcome to my 7th Project in OpenClassroom : The Grandpybot

### What is it ?

It's a simple app develop in Flash and React that allow you to ask grandpy the address of a place and it will give you 
the address, a map of the place and little anecdote from his past. I know he's old and it's always the same story, but 
he really enjoy tell his old story.


### How to run it

To run it yourself you need to clone the repo and then :

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

But you also need to add your own Google API's key !

Put it in the settings section. 

You need to also change the api key in the getMap function in App.js

(The key on there is limited to my site. So won't work anywhere else.)

And Voil√† !

## Enjoy
